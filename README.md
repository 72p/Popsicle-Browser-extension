# Popsicle - An Open Source 'New Tab' Extension For Google Chrome

[Check out Popsicle in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/popsicle/loigpbgkmjjhjodnhlpmbjmojchpdjih?hl=en-US)

## A very minimal New Tab extension for Google Chrome.

Popsicle gives you a minimal new tab page, with new, inspiring quotes every time you open a new tab.

In the settings page, you can fully customize this plugin. Choose from 35 different quote categories, completely tweak the color scheme, and add a background image.

## Todo

I have quite a few ideas I'd like to implement in the future:

- **User Themes** - Be able to search and download themes made by Popsicle users
- **User Plugins** - Be able to search and download plugins made by Popsicle users. What is a plugin, you might ask? A plugin will allow you to add various widgets to your new tab page. Ex. a Bitcoin price ticker, weather in your local area, sales analytics of your products, and more.
- **More Than Two Rows Of Links** - Be able to add additional rows/columns to categorize all of your most important links.
- **Custom Fonts & CSS** - This feature will open an entire new world of creative possibilities in Popsicle.

_In this screenshot, you can see the settings page. Here, you have the ability to change the quote categories to topics that most interest you, add/remove links to pages you visit frequently, change your color scheme, change the background image, adjust the background image opacity, and disable/enable the background image from displaying.
