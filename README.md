## A very minimal New Tab extension for Google Chrome & Opera.

Popsicle gives you a minimal new tab page, with new, inspiring quotes every time you open a new tab.

In the settings page, you can fully customize this plugin. Choose from 35 different quote categories, completely tweak the color scheme, and add a background image.
